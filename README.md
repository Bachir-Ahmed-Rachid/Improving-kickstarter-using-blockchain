Improving kickstarter using blockchain to protect contributors 
Kickstarter is a funding platform for creative projects. Everything from films, games, and music to art, design, and technology. Kickstarter is full of ambitious, innovative, and imaginative ideas that are brought to life through the direct support of others.

Everything on Kickstarter must be a project with a clear goal, like making an album, a book, or a work of art. A project will eventually be completed, and something will be produced by it.
In this repositry i created a DAPP using ReactJs,NextJs,and Solidity to protect all user against fraud.
The principe of this Dapp can be applied in logistics also.
